Memory Game

A simple and fun memory matching game built with React. When the player clicks a card, the entire board shuffles, making it harder to track positions. Each card can only be clicked once; clicking the same card twice results in an instant loss. The game uses React Hooks for state management, dynamic shuffling, and click-tracking logic.
